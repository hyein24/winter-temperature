# winter-temperature
Describing temperature fluctuations during the winter season

# What I Did
1. Generation temperature (minimum/maximum) data generation

2. Average temperature calculation: ( minimum temperature + maximum temperature) / 2 + error

3. Error range is set to data with a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 0.2

4. 3D graph visualization
